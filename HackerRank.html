  <div id="Description">
    <p>I like to practice and learn with programming challenges on hackerrank.com.  Primarily I focus on algorithmic challenges.  I have currently completed 49 challenges in the algorithms domain, which has earned me a badge in algorithms from the site.  I compete in algorithmic programming contests on the site as well.  I currently have two bronze medals for finishing in the top 25% of programmers in two separate contests.</p>
    <p>A second key domain I have studied on hackerrank.com is machine learning.  I have complete fewer challenges in this domain, but nonetheless enough to earn a badge in the subject.  This required challenges in bot-building and statistics.</p>
    <p>I also completed a machine learning challenge in natural language processing, making a language detector. By collecting language samples from wikipedia articles, and writing algorithms to count words, I was able to find the most frequently used words in the following languages: English, French, Spanish, and German.  Next, by filtering duplicates (particularly between Spanish and French), I was able to create unique lists for each of these languages.  Finally, given an input text, this algorithm counts each time one of the words from each of these language lists shows up.  The largest sum is the language in question.</p>

    <p>Aside from algorithms and machine learning, I have been learning C, Java, and SQL on hackerrank.  The site is a great tool for learning, and I am looking forward to further development of my skills and badges on the site.</p>
