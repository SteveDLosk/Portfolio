  <div id="Description">
    <p>The first professional application I developed was a labor estimating program for a manufacturing firm.  Estimating how much time various jobs would take to run was a challenge for the production planner.
    Run times were not a simple linear function of quantity, because the machine had to start slow, get “dialed in” to an optimal running state, and then increased to full production speed.</p>
    <p>For this project, I worked with the planner to understand needs and discuss user interface (UI) considerations. I gathered production data, developed an algorithm for making run estimates, and created a UI for inputting data.
    
    Since the actual program contains sensitive company information, I cannot share the actual code.  I changed the UI for the screenshots, to represent what a similar application for a different manufacturing company may look like.</p>

    <p>The algorithm relies on production data gathered from the shop floor.  It is all contained within a class I created.  Members of this class include production inputs as ints, doubles, and enums.  I next created a method for determining how much was produced as a function of time.  This is calculated using a while loop, until the amount produced equals or exceeds the amount required for the job.</p>
    <p>Extensive testing verified this algorithm is sufficiently fast for all production jobs this facility engages in.  With all inputs in the form filled, a click of the calculate button computes all jobs and outputs the results in a blink of an eye.</p>
