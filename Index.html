     <H1>Software Developer</H1>
     <p>I am a resourceful, creative self-taught software developer.  I have a passion for cross-platform technology, as well as continuous learning.  This portfolio details who I am as a developer, some key projects I have completed, and a few other interesting insights into me.  So, read on and get to know me!

     <h2>Education</h2>
     <p>I came to software development through an unconventional path.  Because of the way life played out, I was unable to attend classes in person at a university when I decided to get into engineering.  To feed my quest for learning, I opted to pursue a business education, which I could get online, and advance my professional career first. </p>
     <p>I got a bachelor's’ degree in Business Administration from City University of Seattle.  This degree includes a well-rounded business education, in traditional subjects (marketing, accounting, operations management, finance), as well as some other mind developing subjects (communications, critical thinking, ethics).</p>
     <p>Besides the bachelor's’ degree, I went on to get my M.B.A. with a concentration on Sustainable Business.  This degree reinforces the business education I got with my first degree, while including an additional study of how businesses ought to operate in the present day, seeking harmony and sustainability with the earth and communities in which they operate.</p>
     <p>To learn coding, I have used a combination of self-study out of books and formal online courses on platforms such as Coursera, Udacity, Microsoft Virtual Academy, and Udemy.  I learned the basics of programming and object oriented design in Python, from Coursera’s Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python, parts 1 and 2.  I also studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, cloud networking, and cyber security on Coursera.  I have taken similar courses through the other platforms I mentioned above, notably including courses in mobile development, C#, XAML, and Java.</p>
     
     <h2>Code Challenges</h2>
     <p>I do a lot of my time coding working on my own projects.  For additional practice, and to work on algorithm efficiency, I like to practice coding on HackerRank.com.  It is a great platform to practice software engineering on.  I have had to redesign technically correct algorithms I have written to improve efficiency, both in running time and memory usage</p>
     <p>I also enjoy competing in HackerRank’s coding challenges.  The pressure of solving specific problems under the provided time constraints helps enforce discipline.  I have currently earned two bronze medals in competitions through HackerRank, as well as a badge for algorithms and a badge for machine learning challenges.</p>
